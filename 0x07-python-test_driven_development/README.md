## 0x07. Python - Test-driven development
## Concept: Never forget a test
# This is a Python Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. The objective of this project is as stated thus:
•	Why Python programming is awesome
•	What’s an interactive test
•	Why tests are important
•	How to write Docstrings to create tests
•	How to write documentation for each module and function
•	What are the basic option flags to create tests
•	How to find edge cases

* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* our code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* Code by: Lawrence Maduabuchi
* Date: June 29th 2023
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
