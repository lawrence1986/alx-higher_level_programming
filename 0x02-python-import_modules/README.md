##0x02. Python - import & modules

This is a Python Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. The objective of this project is to understand the concept about **python programming **.

* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* our code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* Code by: Lawrence Maduabuchi

##General
•	Why Python programming is awesome
•	How to import functions from another file
•	How to use imported functions
•	How to create a module
•	How to use the built-in function dir()
•	How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
•	How to use command line arguments with your Python programs
##General Requirement
•	Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
•	All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
•	All your files should end with a new line
•	The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
•	A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
•	Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
•	All your files must be executable
•	The length of your files will be tested using wc
